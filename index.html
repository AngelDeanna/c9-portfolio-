        <p><i> MY INTRESTS </i></p>
        <p>Sports and food,I love playing sports and also love watching them,
    they get my adrenaline going and always have a good time doing 
    it with my friends and family.I can not deny my craving for all foods.
    I love trying new foods.When I was little I was so picky with the food I ate
    until I started getting older I tried a variety of food from different
    cultures and places.

<p><i>MY HOBBIES</i></p> 
<p>Some of my hobbies would be drawing and listening to music. 
I love both these things for the fact they both help to express
my feelings. I got into drawing since I was little like every other
kid but I stuck to it , not like most.
It became a passion for a while but I stopped and once realized i
t a good idea to express my feelings.
